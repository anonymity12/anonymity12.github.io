people are easy to tell by their music taste.

id like to introduce the music taste of me. 

and by analysing why i like such kind music, we come to the conclusion: what kinds of person I am.

# as a baby

my parents are music fans, since i was borned, i remember that we have a music player at home. it is that kind player which you put tapes into it, using big(type 1) battery. it's a black one, big as a pot.

at that time, what i listen are most Chinese music, which are talking about youth, living in big city, family, old time memory, and of course, many about our great country.

so, here is my taste in my early life: family and country.

# pop music and mid school

i start to listen to pop chinese music when i got mid school, maybe in sichuan, 2006.

it was a period of prosperity of chinese pop music, Jay zhou, daolang, 周传雄, 孙燕姿，梁咏琪, SHE, and many others crated in mainland of china, besides of those who are actually Singaporean, Malysiain(?).

some really great singer come out later on, such as XuSong

also, i start to listen to some really nice eng music from Taylor Swift, Adele, Pink<Try>, Bruno Mars, Jackson...

# shit come out after 2015 maybe

some TV programme bring us too much shit, since 2015 i guess.
