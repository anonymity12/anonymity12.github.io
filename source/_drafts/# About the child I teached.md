# About the child I teached 

I teached some child to learn English after the Examination of Graduation Entrance. I teached them in a small company in my hometown, name YiXuePai. And the slogan of this company is: Learn Three-Year Vocabulary Just in Three Days.

Apparently, the slogan is a lie.

But most parents have to 'believe'.

Ok, the first one I teach is a girl, name Fengyijun. She is a student in her third year of middle school. She's outgoing, the reason is that when I told her that it's my first time to teach someone in such a institition, she say that she will understand.

I treat everyone as equal. So I make my choice to tell my first student the truth. 

And lucky for me, my first student later tell me that I was the first 'teacher' among all these 'teachers' that she met with so great honesty.

And now let me talk more about the details about how I teach.

Normally, a device is required for such English tutoring institution, and such device used in this company is an Android Tablet with an app which is specially designed for this hardware. Second, there is a really 'stupid way' (as far as I am concerned) to teach the 'machine-like' students.

(pic of technique)

Above shown the sequences of how teachers walk through all the vocabularies with his/her student. (teacher and student is one to one in one class). 

Really boring and hard to explain the sequences. All in all, the core is repeat, constantly repeat, repeat with 'machine-like' style. 

Although, it's true that if you want to memorize a word, the core technique you use, at the very begin, is repeat. Especially in such a environment that most middle school teacher never try to use English. So teachers have to follow such a way, and students also obey, as always.

I don't like the technique, to be honest, but since parents just paid almost ten thousand for their child(6000+ RMB for a middle school student to finish all his/her vocabularies), I think there are reasons.

- Parents in small county are so eager for their child to get good score in school, and these parents barely know any appropriate ways to learn English, so they paid for this company who say: memorize all vocabulary in 3 days. Then parents just pray for or wish that every is going well ever after.

- The company runner recruit new teacher from near university or even high school who are familiar with English and want to earn some money in his/her vacation(so am I and my brother). Such (fake)teacher won't try to teach students in accordance with their aptitude, because their limitation and unnecessary improvement.

Besides the stupid way to teach students, cause I have no attention for money, then I start my way to teach, begin from Fengyijun.

I respect my students. People always say, students who were sent to in extracurricular class are bad students with stupid brain. That's work for me, I saw every student I teached are really potential genius, as long as a mentor to guide them the way. 

The second student, oh I shall say it's two boys, I teach them Reading all the Sunday. One is named Zhaoyongkang, another is Duyongqi. What I did is I read 3 articles with them, I finish one Cloze Test with them. They behave pretty good and in every break, we talk, I will share some tips of my own to finish a test, and the attitude of learn, and how to set goals for their universtiy. They are facing their College Entrance Exam this summer.

The third is a girl name XXX, she is in her first year of middle school and just 15 words to learn in my lesson, so I explain the meanings and correct the pronunciation and some teachnique to remember a word, such as 'divide and momerize'.

The last one is a boy, maybe also the one cause my end of teaching, name YYY. I teach YYY the same way as XXX, but he is high school students and he seems like an introversion obedience, he have to finish 45 words in that lesson, so I try my best to teach him, I spent almost 2 hours maybe, and this violate the technique this company required: the stupid repeat like machine. A women then came and corrected my way, and say: you don't need to teach students in accordance with their aptitude. That's really a disrespect for teacher and also for the student I think.

OK, that's all the students I teached in 3 or 4 days. 

In the end, what really impress me are: 

1. education market and enviroment in small county is a mess. Teachers in school suffer a lot, so they go out and launch small company like this to earn extra money.
2. parents in small county with little high education experience is blind when they want their child have a good score.
3. students are so weak to speak for their own opinion, they are sad genius like flowers to be ruined in a always-gloomy season.
