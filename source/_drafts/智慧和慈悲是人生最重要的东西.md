the day my father seemed was cheated by his college classmate.

reason is i have a not-ideal score in the chinese master degree entrance examnation.

the score came out as 332 in 2020.02.20

his college classmate was a female teacher or post-phd teacher.

she use some tricks persuade my father to give my info immediately, cause she know someone might help me to enter university.

so we did what she told, my father even said to give some money for her in advance for such generous help. She refused.

ever since Qin dynasty, we are accustomed to bribery.

Then her phone call was came, she already submit my info to some teacher maybe, and they already make a deal that I will have a chance as long as my father pay the huge amount tuition, which indeed a huge amount money for our family.

She made the decision for a village-borned student that going to a noble school that originally set for the rich.

She is a women lack of mercy, and I think she lack of wisdom, too.

People who take possession of wisdom, I think, are those who know the secret path to pure-good or DAO in China.
