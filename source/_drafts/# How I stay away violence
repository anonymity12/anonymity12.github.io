# How I stay away violence

It's always hard for me to use violence, I am seldom angry with someone, I just annoy, and I will keep fear, imagination, violence inside my mind, and keeping them inside result in that I am the only victim.

So I decide, since I rarely use violenct to others, I can't use it to myself, so I should keep stable, kind, happy, with little eager for the outside world. 

The way to leave fear, violence in imagination and emotion torture is keep stable, keep who I am, as always, as I find who I am during my growth.
